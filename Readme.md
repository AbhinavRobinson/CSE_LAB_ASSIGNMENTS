# CS CLASS ASSIGNMENTS 

### Lab Assignments - EMAT203L
These are assignments from EMAT203L, where I take a look at the questions with a more complex algorithm than needed, this exercise is not for optimization but purely fun :)

### Lab Assignments - ECSE207L 
These are assignments of Data Structures, pretty straight foward, commented moderately for readibility :)

### Assignments done by Abhinav Robinson, Copy at your own risk <3
